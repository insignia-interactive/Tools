# Tools
Tools can help to create and setup new Unity Projects.

## Instructions
You can install this package in two ways.
### A) Package Manager (GIT URL)
The suggested way to install this package is through the Unity's Package Manager itself, via a GIT url. This way, you will be notified once new versions get released, and you will be able to download them directly from the Unity Editor.

-> **The GIT URL you need to add to the Package manager is the following** (copy and paste it): **https://github.com/insignia-interactive/Unity-Tools.git**

For more info on how to install custom packages from a GIT Url, please read here: https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html

### B) Manual Install
You can also install this package manually, by copying the source files directly into your project's assets folder. (You'd have to do this every time there is a new update.)

---

### Use
After the installation, you can use the package features.
#### Create Default Folders:
• Navigate to and click `Setup\Create Default Folders`.

#### Load Default Packages:
• Navigate to and click `Setup\Load New Manifest`.

#### Install Packages:
• Navigate to `Setup\Packages`.

• Navigate to whatever which ever package you would like to install and click the button.
